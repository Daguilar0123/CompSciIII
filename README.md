Data Structures & Algorithms in Python – Course Progress Repository

This repository documents my progress through a Data Structures and Algorithms course at Rockland Community College, based on the textbook Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (2022).
It contains Python code examples that I transcribed from the textbook. Although the original examples were mostly verbatim from the book, I encountered
several challenges along the way—typos, missing text, and incomplete examples—that required troubleshooting and modification until the code worked as intended.

Repository Overview

The repository is organized into two main sections:

Python Code Examples

These files showcase implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:
	•	Stacks and Queues
	•	SimpleStack.py, SimpleStackClient.py, SimpleStackClient2.py
	•	Stack.py, StackClient.py
	•	Queue.py, QueueClient.py
	•	PriorityQueue.py, PriorityQueueClient.py
	•	Linked Lists
	•	LinkedList.py
	•	DoubleEndedList.py, DoubleEndedListClient.py
	•	Miscellaneous Examples
	•	ReverseWord.py – Uses a stack to reverse a word.
	•	DelimeterChecker.py – Checks for balanced delimiters.
	•	PostfixTranslate.py – Demonstrates parsing arithmetic expressions.
	•	IncrementByRef.py – Illustrates concepts on passing values by reference.

Each of these scripts is taken from textbook examples but has been corrected or completed as needed. They represent not only the theoretical material but also my
process of debugging and refining the code through practical experimentation.

Textbook Reference

Note: Although my learning was guided by the textbook, no textbook files are included in this repository. The PDFs were used solely as a reference during the process.

Purpose and Process

The aim of this repository is to share my learning journey and thought process throughout the class. Here’s what you can expect:
	•	Transcription and Adaptation: I began by transcribing the code from the textbook.
	•	Troubleshooting: I encountered typographical errors, incomplete examples, and missing text.
	•	Debugging and Refinement: Through testing and troubleshooting, I corrected and completed the examples until they ran correctly.
	•	Documentation: This repository serves as a portfolio of my efforts to bridge theory and practice while learning key data structures and algorithms.

How to Use

Each Python file is self-contained and intended to demonstrate a particular concept. To run an example, ensure you have Python 3 installed and execute the desired file. For example:

python3 SimpleStackClient.py

Final Note

This repository only includes my Python files and does not distribute any copyrighted material from the textbook. It is entirely my work—reflecting both the original ideas from
the book and my improvements along the way.
